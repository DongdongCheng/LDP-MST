# LDP-MST
The matlab code of "Clustering with local density peaks-based minimum spanning tree"
LDPMST_OPT.m includes LDP-MST algorithm (Algorithm 3 of the manuscript), LDP_Searching.m includes Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2.
LMSTCLU_OPT.m is used to cluster local density peaks with MST-based clustering algorithm.
drawcluster2 is used to draw the clustering result.
Synthetic data sets pacake includes the synthetic data sets we used in the experiment
